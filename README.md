# Neo4j - PotgreSQL - SpringBoot

## Papper abstract
```
In this paper, the issue of hierarchy among data is presented. In addition, the most common
models for realizing hierarchy in the SQL domain of relational databases and also in the
domain of NOSQL on the graph model are explained. The paper compares the mentioned
models according to the requirements of the complexity of query writing, visualization and
the difficulty of implementation.
Through the work, we made an introduction to the Neo4j graphic database and the Cypher
query language.
Through the SpringBoot framework, the Neo4j database was integrated with the existing
IoT Polje project and additional services, which were developed as part of the R project.
Through the work, a hybrid solution of the hierarchy was developed, which does not
depend on the existing design and implementation of data storage. In other words, we have
created a hierarchy solution that is easily integrated with existing relational database.
